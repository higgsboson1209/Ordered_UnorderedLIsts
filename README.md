# Ordered_UnorderedLIsts
C++ code for implementing static lists 
1)UNORDERED LISTS-a list implemented in c++ which doesn't follow any specific ordere and insertion deletion and updation can be done anywhere 


2)ORDERED LISTS- a list implemented in c++ which follows a specific order as hard coded by me, but can be any order as the user wants for deletion and updation one needs to follow the specific order
